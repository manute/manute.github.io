My name is Manuel Alonso and I´m a <strong>passionate Software Developer</strong> trying to learn and improve in any project.<br/>
I´ve been working in software development for many years, mainly in the <strong>JVM and Javascript</strong>.
I like read books and learn all the time. Now I'm interested in <strong>functional programming</strong> because is really fun!
